## Array - Two numbers sum up to an expected sum

# Problem Description

We're looking for a function, which takes in an array containing distinct integers values and a second integer value, which represents a sum to build out of two numbers inside the array. The functions returns an array of two numbers, which add up to our expected sum - assuming that only one pair of integers adds up to our sum. An empty array is returned if there aren't two numbers which add up to the expected sum

Sample input: [4, 1, -5, 7, 12, 6, -3, 13], 10
